# Project-Management-System

Description :- This system enables user to store data related to the specific project in a database. The database which I used in this project is JsonPowerDB.

Benefits of using JsonPowerDB : JsonPowerDB is a Database Server with Developer friendly REST API services. It's a High Performance, Light Weight, Ajax Enabled, Serverless, Simple to Use, Real-time Database.

Easy and fast to develop database applications without using any server side programming / scripting or without installing any kind of database.

Whether it's a Dynamic Website or a Mobile App or some Data Analytics Portal, the development is real fun and fast.
